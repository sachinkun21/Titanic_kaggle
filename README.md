## Titanic: Kaggle
## Problem Statement

### Introduction

In this kernel I will go through the whole process of creating a machine learning model on the famous Titanic dataset, which is used by many people all over the world. It provides information on the fate of passengers on the Titanic, summarized according to economic status (class), sex, age and survival. In this challenge, I will predict whether a passenger on the titanic would have been survived or not.

### About Titanic 

RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after it collided with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. There were an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship, and more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history. The RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time it entered service and was the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line. The Titanic was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, her architect, died in the disaster.

### About the Data Set

We have data of all passengers and the problem statement is to predict the survival  of a passenger given his current data inputs. The complete data can be downloaded here - www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
